### Composition:
One class composed of other classes
Delays the creation of backend objects until they are needed. (Lazy Loading) 

### Inheritance:
One class is a subclass of another class
All subclasses must implement the superclass methods. Not always good if superclass aint needed in subclass

### Dynamic Binding:
means the JVM will decide at runtime which method implementation
to invoke based on the class of the object.

### Polymorphism:
means you can use a variable of a superclass type to hold a reference
to an object whose class is the superclass or any of its subclasses.

## Delegation:
One class calls a method from another class

### Facade:
Using a class that handles the method calls from the other classes.
Acts as a buffer before the the methods reach the client code (client code calls from the facade, not the classes directly)
